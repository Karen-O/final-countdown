#The Final Countdown!
How close to 0 can you get?

Your goal is to make the page you see at http://ga-dc.github.io/final-countdown, editing only the <script> element.

Things to note:

		The counter starts at 1234.

		When clicked, it begins counting down.

		When clicked while counting, it stops.

		When clicked while stopped, it resets to 1234 and starts counting down again.

		When it reaches 0, it takes on a class called "fail", which makes the text turn red.

		It cannot go below 0.
